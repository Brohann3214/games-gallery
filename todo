DONE
- throttle requests
- make a missing image graphic for fallback
- detect https://makecode.com/_g3sMJHh8dYi5 links

- redirect `/` to `/latest` ?  https://nextjs.org/docs/api-reference/next.config.js/redirects
- configure subdomain on jacobcarpenter.com
- it seems like the forum tagging/categorization is not what it used to be; maybe update queries to not rely on tags?
- configure lint
